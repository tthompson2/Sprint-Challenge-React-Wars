1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React JS is a programming language that allows you to contain all of the different sections of front-end including Markup, Styling, and functionality (Javascript). It is designed to solve the problem of usability regarding creating internal libraries within teams and since all of the individual pieces of the froent can be tied together it makes the process of making changes to the code much easier for the programmer that knows how to use all of them effectively

1. What does it mean to think in react?


 To think in React you need to think with components, state, and props. You need to understand that will need to connect different components together, and figure out how information is supposed to flow between the components to be able to determine how to render/build React Applications.

1. Describe state.

State determines exact;y how each object in React behaves and renders. This value can be constantly changed in real time based on how it is programmed by the programmer.

1. Describe props.

Props are the values associated with each of the different components that are used to pass individual values around between each of the different components.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

 Hooks are used to sync effects in a react component. Side effects result in changes that can be observed when a calculation (such as an API call is completed).
